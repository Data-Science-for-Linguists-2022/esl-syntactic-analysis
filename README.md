# esl-syntactic-analysis

Tianyi Zheng, tiz65@pitt.edu

This project will analyze written data from ESL learners and identify differences in syntax of different ESL learners based on their native language and proficiency level.
The goal is to determine how quantitative measures of syntactic complexity differ between more advanced learners and less advanced learners and to determine whether they differ between learners based on their L1.
